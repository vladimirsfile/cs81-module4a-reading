1. What was the most helpful aspect of this code’s structure?

To me the most helpful aspect of the code's structure is that it is organized into small, separate functions. This makes the code easier to understand, reusable, and more scalable. 

2. What part was confusing or took longer to understand?

It was hard for me to understand what was the purpose of using array of object. Before, I would have tried to create separate object. However, I realized that by using an array of objects, you can easily loop through the data, and keep related information together, so you don't have to worry about the minutes matching the right title, for example.
